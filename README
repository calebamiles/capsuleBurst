This repository contains an attempt to model the vortex ring created by a moss capsule bursting. This repository contains (so far) three cases. 

	axisymmetric: A 2D domain using wedge boundaries for the front and back to reproduce an axisymmetric case in FLUENT
	bottomSymmetryPlane: A 2D domain using a symmetry plane at the bottom, so that half of a 2D cross section is simulated
	simple2D: A 2D domain simulating a 2D slice of the 3D domain
